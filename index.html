        <img src="MyWebPage\redmiNote5.jpg" width =200 >
        <p>Xiaomi's popular Redmi series needs no introduction in India. The Chinese company managed to grab a huge pie out of the smartphone industry mainly because of the Redmi series. The Redmi Note series was an instant hit with the phablet-loving Indian audience. With last year's Redmi Note 4 breaking many records in the online segment, it's time for the company to reveal the next iteration of the device.
The Redmi Note 5 has leaked a couple times earlier this month with impressive specifications in both design and hardware. The claims of an imminent launch got stronger when Xiaomi's alleged Redmi Note 5 was spotted on TENAA, China's certification site.</p>

  <img class="img" src="MyWebPage\images\honor7X.jpg" alt="none" width=200>
  <p class="para">Huawei's online subsidiary brand, Honor, is all set to launch the successor of the Honor 6X on October 11. Dubbed Honor 7X, the new smartphone is set to launch in China first. The company confirmed the launch in a Weibo post.
<br>
    The company's Weibo post seemingly also confirms that the Honor 7X will be sticking to the current trend, and may feature an 18:9 display or a full view display. Considering that the Honor 6X came with a dual camera setup at the back, we can expect the Honor 7X to also follow the suite.</p>

  <h3 id=samsungGalaxyS9>Samsung Galaxy S9</h3>
  <img src="MyWebPage\images\samsungGalaxyS9.jpg" alt="none" width =200>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S8 only hit stores earlier this year, but we're already hearing rumors of the Samsung Galaxy S9, with one report claiming the phone is already in the first few stages of production.

The rumors are now coming thick and fast for what the new phone will look like, especially as we've now seen the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 and the iPhone 8, so we've rounded up the best of them here - as well as answering some key questions.

<h5>What's the new Samsung Galaxy S9 news?</h5>
The latest leaks suggest the Samsung Galaxy S9 will support modular accessories but without a fingerprint built into the screen (sadly, still around the back). It'll have the new powerful Snapdragon 845 chipset powering things but it will stick with 4GB of RAM, rather than 6GB as other modern smartphones have.

<h5>What will the Samsung Galaxy S9 price be?</h5>
We're expecting £639 / $725 / AU$1200 based on current projections, as we're expecting the Galaxy S9 to come in around the same price as its predecessor. Given we're not expecting massive design changes, we doubt too high a price rise.</p>

  <h3 id="LgG7"> LG G7</h3>
  <img src="MyWebPage\images\lgG7.jpg" alt="none" width="200">
  <p>
    The LG G6 was recently unleashed onto the world, but we’ve already started thinking about its successor, the LG G7.

    What will it look like, what’ll be inside, and will LG finally cut it out with the region-specific features? Let's get started.

    Below, you’ll find the developing story of the G7 as we know it through rumors, leaks and confirmed news. And of course, we’ve added our own two cents as to how we hope next year’s flagship comes together.
    <h5>LG G7 release date and price</h5>
The LG G7 launch date is likely to happen at MWC 2018, so we’re likely to see it on or around Sunday, February 25, 2018.
That’s our best guess based on the fact that both the LG G6 and LG G5 were launched at MWC. The Barcelona conference is a big, easy venue for LG to gain worldwide attention. This comes a few months after the rumored IFA 2017 launch of the LG V30.
If you’re a year into your carrier’s two-year contract, you’ll be in prime position to snag the G7 when it comes out in the Spring season. However, it won’t be cheap. In line with other LG flagships, we expect it cost north of $700 at retail, around $729 ((about £568, AU$967). It’s a lot of cash, but as much as some others. The Samsung Galaxy S8, for example, retails at $750. </p>
